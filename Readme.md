# Tensor Flow MNIST Tutorial

This is a compilation of the first Tensor flow tutorials working with the MNIST data available at [Yann LeCun's Website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

The first tutorial is a basic regression model that achieves roughly 91% accuracy in labeling handwritten digits (0-9).

The deeper learning notebook impliments 2 convolutional layers to create a small neural network that increases the accuracy of the preditions to a little over 99%.
